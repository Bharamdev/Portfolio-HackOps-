# Portfolio-HackOps-
## Inspiration
I’ve always wanted a unique, interactive space to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a web developer. Instead of using a generic template, I challenged myself to design and build a personalized portfolio website from scratch. The idea was to turn a traditional resume into a living, interactive product that reflects both my technical skills and creative edge.

## What it does
HackOps is a personal portfolio website where visitors can:

    Explore my projects with cool hover effects and animations.

    Learn about my coding journey and skills.

    Connect with me through integrated social media links.

    Experience smooth transitions and engaging visuals.

## How we built it
I built this website using:

    HTML for structuring the content.

    CSS for styling and layout.

    JavaScript to add interactivity.

    GSAP and CSS animations for smooth transitions and dynamic effects.

Every section was carefully designed to ensure it’s lightweight, responsive, and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Challenges we ran into
Animation timing conflicts: Getting multiple animations to synchronize smoothly without affecting page performance.

Responsive layout adjustments: Making sure animations and layouts work well on different screen sizes.

Maintaining performance: Balancing visual effects with fast load times and responsiveness.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully built a fully animated, responsive portfolio without any frameworks.

Created smooth hover effects and transitions using GSAP and CSS keyframes.
